# UMassDiningRedesign
CS325 - Human/Computer Interaction

Fall 2019

  For many years, students at the University of Massachusetts Amherst have struggled to find a dining 
venue on campus that matches what their taste buds are in the mood for. With each location having 
such a wide variety of unique options, students often find themselves at a loss when it comes to 
where to eat on campus. Incoming freshmen as well as new transfer students on campus especially 
struggle with this as many often have difficulty even locating or learning about all the locations 
that offer food on campus. Thus, we want students at UMass Amherst to have a consolidated platform 
in which they can discover all the dining locations on campus and receive tailored recommendations 
based on the individual student’s specific preferences. Therefore, the activity that we wish to 
support is the student’s choice of where to eat on campus, especially around dinnertime. At the 
current moment, all the UMass dining halls, as well as food vendors on campus have separate menus
with differing options. On top of this, many of the dining halls will often serve special dishes 
which are only offered occasionally and are easy to miss. Therefore, our app’s goal is to find out 
what the student’s food preference is and give them recommendations based upon what is available 
across all locations on campus while also notifying students about any special events. As mentioned 
earlier, some students also struggle with finding and accessing certain locations on campus. A good 
example of this are the student run organizations that are not directly affiliated with the campus 
dining halls. As a result, we wish to support a student’s ability to discover and locate all of 
these locations by using a mapping feature that will allow each user to see exactly where their 
desired food venue is.

  My group and I designed a prototype for a potential resdesign of the UMass Dining app that also includes
a questionnaire feature, which recommends a few dining locations based on a quick survey, and a map feature, 
which pinpoints the locations of all dining halls, on-campus restaurants, and student run businesses using
the Google Maps API.
